# A-Level Comp-Sci AQA Paper 1 Prerelease Material practice
 - Repository for my solutions to AQA's paper 1 pre release C# program's **practice** questions.
 - Contains a variety of tasks in increasing complexity.
 - All solutions are in their own seperate class / file.
 - To run solution X, change `placeholder bc im on the toilet` to `placeholder lawl`.
 - I programmed all of these for practice for the real thing.
 - The prerelease program should be worth about 40% of 2025's Paper 1 marks.
